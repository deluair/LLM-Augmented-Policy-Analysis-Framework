"""
Functions and classes for calculating metrics related to the quality of insights.

These metrics assess aspects like the novelty, actionability, relevance, coverage,
and evidence-based nature of the insights generated by the analysis framework.
These may often involve heuristics, qualitative assessment rubrics, or comparison
against expert judgments or baseline information retrieval systems.

    Calculates a score representing the novelty of an insight.

    Novelty is assessed by comparing the insight against a baseline set of
    existing knowledge (e.g., previous reports, common sense facts, results
    from a simpler baseline system). A lower similarity to existing knowledge
    implies higher novelty.

    Args:

                                       knowledge points or previously generated insights.
        comparison_method (str): The method used for comparison (e.g., 'keyword_overlap',
                                'semantic_similarity' using embeddings).
        **kwargs: Additional arguments depending on the comparison method
                  (e.g., embedding model path, similarity threshold).

    Calculates a score representing the actionability of an insight.

    Actionability refers to how easily the insight can inform a decision or
