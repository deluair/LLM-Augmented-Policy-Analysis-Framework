"""
Analyzes central bank communications to determine the monetary policy stance 
(hawkish vs. dovish).

- Hawkish: Indicates a preference for tighter monetary policy (e.g., higher 
  interest rates) primarily to combat inflation.
- Dovish: Indicates a preference for looser monetary policy (e.g., lower 
  interest rates) primarily to stimulate economic growth and employment.
